    Definition

        The Clap module is an easy-to-use command-line argument parser for
        Python projects.

    Notice

        This is the last official version for the Python 2.x framework. If you
        need later versions for that framework for whatever reason, you can
        try refactoring the syntax from Python 3.x to version 2.x using the
        '3to2' tool.

        However, there is no guarantee that this works properly or at all.
