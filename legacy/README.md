# Legacy

This directory contains old stable releases that are still officially available, but neither maintained nor supported any longer.

However, as long as the repository is not read-only, negligible non-code changes may still be applied (e.g. updated links to sites in a text file). Nevertheless, there will be no new release despite any changes.
